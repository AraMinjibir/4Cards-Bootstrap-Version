# 4Cards-Bootstrap-Version

# Project Description

In my pursuit of becoming a proficient front-end developer, I embraced the challenge to showcase my basic skills in responsive design using the Bootstrap component framework.

This project encompasses a container named 'Container-fluid,' housing a 'Grid system Container' (row) within it. The 'Grid system Container' consists of one div container and three columns.

The div container contains a welcome note and an advertisement about the company.

The three columns of the grid system container are spanned to four columns from medium devices up to extra-extra-large (i.e., col-md-4). Thus, each column will span 12 columns on small mobile screens.

Within the second column of our earlier grid container, there are two grid system columns nested. They span 12 columns from small mobile screens up to extra-extra-large screens.

The font-family used was 'Poppins,' sans-serif, and the font sizes were consistently 14px, 15px, and 16px across the entire project. The font weights used were 600, 500, 400, and 200.

Three distinct background colors were used: 'bg-secondary' with a background opacity of 25 for the body, 'bg-light' with a background opacity of 100 for 'container-fluid,' and 'bg-white' with no opacity for the cards. The card borders are differentiated with the following colors:
- Red: hsl(0, 78%, 62%)
- Cyan: hsl(180, 62%, 55%)
- Orange: hsl(34, 97%, 64%)
- Blue: hsl(212, 86%, 64%)

The font colors used for the cards are:
- Very Dark Blue: hsl(234, 12%, 34%)
- Grayish Blue: hsl(229, 6%, 66%)
- Very Light Gray: hsl(0, 0%, 98%)
